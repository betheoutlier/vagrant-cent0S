vagrant-centOS
================

This is a Vagrant build of a very basic LAMP server.

Most of this is based on the vagrant cloud box [box-cutter/centos510](https://vagrantcloud.com/box-cutter/boxes/centos510) and all credit is owed to them. 

I simply added basic provisioning for: 
* Apache 2.2,
* MySQL 5.5,
* PHP Version 5.5,
* Git,
* Drush

This is meant for local and dev use only. This is not a production server. 

Setup and Configuration variables can be set in:
vagrant_config.yml

Initial MySQL Root Password is BLANK.
